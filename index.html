I worked as their in-house designer for five years and had the oppurtunity to tackle various web and print projects.<br /><br />The goal of this redesign was to make the content more digestible and give Infolinx greater first impression credibility. The content was improved by breaking up the main text and adding photos and icons as compliments. To increase perceived credibility, a full-width design with large images was used to help convey that Infolinx is a company who&rsquo;s staying current in the tech industry.</p>

The idea is to create a web app where people can read the Bible in a more social way than current online Bibles.<br /><br />The bread and butter of this social interaction is being able to read, post, and reply to questions and comments on any verse in the Bible. The goal of this social interaction is to lift one another up, that we might be encouraged and better understand the Bible.</p>
